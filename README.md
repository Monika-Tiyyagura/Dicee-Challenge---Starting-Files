# Two-Player Dice Game

Welcome to our two-player dice game! This simple game allows two players to take turns rolling dice to determine who goes first for any task or activity.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: Gather two players and ensure each player has access to a device with a web browser.
2. **Starting the Game**: Decide who goes first by rolling the dice. The player with the highest number will start the game.
3. **Taking Turns**: Players take turns rolling a virtual six-sided die by clicking a button or tapping the screen. The number rolled determines the player's score for that turn.
4. **Winning the Game**: The game does not have a winner in the traditional sense, as its purpose is to determine who goes first for any task or activity. However, players can keep track of their scores for fun.
